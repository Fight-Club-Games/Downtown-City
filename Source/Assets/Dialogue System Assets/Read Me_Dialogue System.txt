NPC Chat and Dialogue System

Version 1.2

Read Me

-This system is designed to allow NPCs(non player characters) the ability to have a chat box with dialogue.
-Create your own textures to use as chatboxes, you can use any image editing program to make basic or 
 highly customized dialogue boxes.
-Use your own fonts on GUIText components to further customize the chat sequences.
-Resize and Position the GUITextures and GUIText through the inspector with the "Transform Scale" and
 "Transform Position" values.

To set up chat follow the steps below.

1.Start by making a basic Cube. On the Box Collider component, make sure the box "Is Trigger" is checked.

2.Add the NPC script associated with your character type to the Cube and fill in the required fields.
 (There are instructions in the inspector to help with configuration.)

3.Add the "GUI_NPC Chat Dialogue System" prefab to the hierarchy, this contains preconfigured talk lines
  and chat boxes. Use an image editor to create custom chat box textures, use them instead of the included boxes!

4.Use a text editor to write and align your chat if you want to use multiple lines, then paste them in the 
 "Talk Lines" element fields.

5.Once your chat is configured, attach the cube to your NPC and disable the mesh renderer.

6.For the third person and first person NPCs, you can increase the size of the box collider to determine when
  you want the player to stop and have a conversation with the NPC. The Third Person click to chat NPC comes 
  with a distance slider that can be used to determine how close or far the player has to be in order to start
  the chat.
